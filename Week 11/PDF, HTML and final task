Final task/question: Based on the data visualizations of homicide rates in Western Europe over time and the reign duration of Danish rulers, we can argue that society has become more "civilized" in certain respects.
The homicide data shows a clear long-term decline in violent deaths per 100,000 people. This trend aligns with historian Steven Pinker’s argument in The Better Angels of Our Nature (2011), which suggests that interpersonal violence has steadily decreased due to stronger institutions, rule of law, and social norms discouraging violence.
The visualization of Danish rulers’ reigns provides another perspective. Longer reigns over time may indicate greater political stability, reducing violent power struggles such as coups and assassinations, which were more common in earlier centuries. This reinforces the idea that societies have developed mechanisms for resolving conflicts through non-violent means.
However, civilization is multifaceted. While homicide rates have dropped, other forms of systemic violence, such as economic inequality, cyber warfare, and environmental degradation—persist. Moreover, war and political violence remain present, albeit in different forms than in the past.
Therefore, if we define “civilization” in terms of declining interpersonal violence and increased political stability, the data supports the argument that we are indeed more civilized today. However, if civilization also includes broader ethical and structural factors, the answer is more complex.
